n_stress - Network stress tester

Simple program designed to saturate a network connection.  Currently it works
very well at crashing poorly programmed routers (the D-Link DIR-655), and
revealing bugs in kernel drivers for gigabit ethernet cards.

It's released under GNU LGPLv3 (you can read more in the license file).

Have fun!
