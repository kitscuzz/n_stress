So this is just barebones code so it doesn't really need a license of any kind
but in case someone cares it's under GNU LGPL v3, in order to match the
liscense from the ccrc32.c and ccrc32.h files.

Those did not include any license file or comment illucidating the fact that
it has this license (like author info), but I downloaded the code from here:
http://www.networkdls.com/Software.Asp?Review=22

And it was noted as being GNU LGPL v3.
